# DB_Final_Project — ShoeStore Management System

This repository contains the initial components of the **Final Term Project** for the *Database Systems* course at Yachay Tech University.  
The project consists of designing a relational database, developing a RESTful API using Flask-SQLAlchemy, and creating a GUI for managing a shoe store inventory and order system.

## 📌 Project Advance 1 — Included in This Repository

For **Project Advance 1 (20%)**, the following components are required and included:

### ✔ Database Schema
The file `ShoeStore.sql` contains the SQL script that defines the full relational database structure, including:
- Supplier  
- Product  
- Customer  
- Orders  
- OrderDetail  
- Shipment  

This schema follows the conceptual and logical design created for the system.

### ✔ API Development (40% Completed)
The file `Flask-MySQL/app_shoestore.py` contains the initial REST API implementation using:
- **Flask**
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**
- **Marshmallow**

CRUD operations implemented at this stage:
- Suppliers (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Products (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

These endpoints are fully functional and connected to the MySQL database.
